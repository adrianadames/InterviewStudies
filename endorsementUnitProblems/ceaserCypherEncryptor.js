=========================
Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and non-negative integers value representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet, where k is the key. Note that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet, in other words, the letter "z" shiffted by 1 returns the letter "a".
Sample input: "xyz", 2
Sample output: "zab"
