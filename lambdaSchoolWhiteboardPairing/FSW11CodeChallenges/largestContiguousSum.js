/*
Given an array of numbers containing at least one positive number (or zero), find the greatest contiguous sum of numbers.

example 1: sumArray([1, 2, 3]);     // => 6 
example 2: sumArray([4, -1, 5]);    // => 8 
example 3: sumArray([10, -11, 11]); // => 11 

Contiguous, in this case, can be as few as zero numbers (an empty subset of the original array, with a total worth of zero).
