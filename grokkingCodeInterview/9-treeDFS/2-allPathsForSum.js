Problem Statement

Given a binary tree and a number ‘S’, find all paths from 
root-to-leaf such that the sum of all the node values of 
each path equals ‘S’.

Ex1

        1
    7      9
  4   5   2  7

S: 12
Output: 2
Explanation: There are the two paths with sum '12':1 -> 7 -> 4 and 1 -> 9 -> 2

Ex2
        12
      7     1
    4      10  5

S: 23
Output: 2
Explanation: Here are the two paths with sum '23':12 -> 7 -> 4 and 12 -> 1 -> 10
