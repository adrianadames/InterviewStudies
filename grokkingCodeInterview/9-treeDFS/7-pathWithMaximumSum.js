Problem Statement

Find the path with the maximum sum in a given binary tree. Write a 
function that returns the maximum sum. A path can be defined as a 
sequence of nodes between any two nodes and doesnâ€™t necessarily pass 
through the root.

Ex1

        1*
    2*      3*
    4*     5   6*   

Output: 16
Explanation: The path with maximum sum is: [4, 2, 1, 3, 6]

Ex2
            1
        2         3*
      1  3      5*    6*
              7  8*     9*

Output: 31
Explanation: The path with maximum sum is: [8, 5, 3, 6, 9]
