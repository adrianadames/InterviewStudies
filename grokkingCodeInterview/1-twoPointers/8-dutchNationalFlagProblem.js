Problem Statement
-Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array 
in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects, 
hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, 
white and blue; and since our input array also consists of 
three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch 
National Flag problem.

// - use a left pointer, middle pointer,right pointer; left at 0, 
// right at arr.length -1, middle at 0;
// - 0s go before left, 2s after right, 1s in the middle
// - if arr[middle] = 0, swap with arr[left] and increment both left and middle; 
// - if arr[middle] = 1, increment middle
// - if arr[middle] = 2, swap with arr[right] and decrement right


// time: O(n);
// space: O(1);
