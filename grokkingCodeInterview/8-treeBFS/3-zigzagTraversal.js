Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its zigzag 
level order traversal. You should populate the values of all 
nodes of the first level from left to right, then right to left 
for the next level and keep alternating in the same manner for 
the following levels.

Ex1

       1
    2     3
 4    5   6  7

Zigzag Level Order Traversal: 
[[1],[3, 2],[4, 5, 6, 7]]   

Ex2
        12
      7    1
    9      10    5
         20 17

Zigzag Level Order Traversal:
[[12],[1,7],[9,10,5][17,20]]
