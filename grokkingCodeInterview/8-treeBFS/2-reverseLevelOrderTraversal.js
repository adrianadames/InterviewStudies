Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its 
level-by-level traversal in reverse order, i.e., the lowest 
level comes first. You should populate the values of all 
nodes in each level from left to right in separate sub-arrays.

Ex1

       1
    2      3
 4    5   6  7

Reverse Level Order Traversal: 
[[4,5,6,7],[2,3],[1]]    

Ex2
        12
      7    1
    9      10  5

Reverse Level Order Traversal: 
[[9,10,5],[7,1],[12]]
