Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent its 
level-by-level traversal. You should populate the values 
of all nodes of each level from left to right in separate 
sub-arrays.

Ex1

        1
    2      3
  4   5   6  7

Level Order Traversal: 
[[1],[2,3],[4,5,6,7]]

Ex2
        12
      7     1
    9      10  5

Level Order Traversal: 
[[12],[7,1],[9,10,5]]
