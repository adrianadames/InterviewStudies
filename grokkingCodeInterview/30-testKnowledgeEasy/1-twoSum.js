/*
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return two distinct indices i and j such that the sum of nums[i] and nums[j] is equal to the target.

You can assume that each input will have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Examples
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Expected Output: [1, 2]
Justification: nums[1] + nums[2] gives 2 + 4 which equals 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5], target = -8
Expected Output:
