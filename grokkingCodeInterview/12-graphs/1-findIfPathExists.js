/*
Given an undirected graph, represented as a list of edges. Each edge is illustrated as a pair of integers [u, v], signifying that there's a mutual connection between node u and node v.

You are also given starting node start, and a destination node end, return true if a path exists between the starting node and the destination node. Otherwise, return false.

Examples
Example 1:
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]], start = 0, end = 3
Expected Output: true
