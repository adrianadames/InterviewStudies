/* (easy)
Given two 2D arrays of item-value pairs, named items1 and items2.

item[i] = [valuei, weighti], where each valuei in these arrays is unique within its own array and is paired with a weighti.
Combine these arrays such that if a value appears in both, its weights are summed up. The final merged array should be sorted based on the valuei.

Examples
Example 1:
Input: items1 = [[1,2],[4,3]], items2 = [[2,1],[4,3],[3,4]]
Expected Output: [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[4,6]]
