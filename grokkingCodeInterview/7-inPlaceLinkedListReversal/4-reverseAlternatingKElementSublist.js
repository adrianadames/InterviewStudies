Problem Statement: 

Given the head of a LinkedList and a number ‘k’, reverse 
every alternating ‘k’ sized sub-list starting from the head.

If, in the end, you are left with a sub-list with less than
‘k’ elements, reverse it too.

original list: k = 2
head ->1 ->2 ->3 ->4 ->5 ->6 ->7 ->8 ->null

reversed sub-list: 
head ->2 ->1 ->3 ->4 ->6 ->5 ->7 ->8 ->null
