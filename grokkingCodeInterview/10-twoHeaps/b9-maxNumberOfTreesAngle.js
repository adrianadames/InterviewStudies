You are standing at the centre of a forest. You can 
point your camera in any direction and capture photos 
of trees. Each tree is represented by a polar coordinate 
Pj in degrees (they are points without dimensions).

Assuming that the camera can take pictures as wide as 90 
degrees, which direction should you point your camera to 
capture the maximum number of trees ?
