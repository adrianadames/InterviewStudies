Problem Statement
Given string s, determine whether it's possible to make a given string palindrome by removing at most one character.

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward.

Examples
Example 1:

Input: "racecar"
Expected Output: true
Justification: The string is already a palindrome, so no removals are needed.
Example 2:

Input: "abccdba"
Expected Output: true
Justification: Removing the character 'd' forms the palindrome "abccba".
Example 3:

Input: "abcdef"
Expected Output:
