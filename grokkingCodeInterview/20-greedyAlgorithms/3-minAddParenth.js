/*
(med)
Given a string str containing '(' and ')' characters, find the minimum number of parentheses that need to be added to a string of parentheses to make it valid.

A valid string of parentheses is one where each opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')' and vice versa. The goal is to determine the least amount of additions needed to achieve this balance.

Examples
Example 1:
Input: "(()"
Expected Output: 1
