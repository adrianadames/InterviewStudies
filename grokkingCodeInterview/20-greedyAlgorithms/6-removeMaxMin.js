Problem Statement
Determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove the smallest and the largest elements from an array of integers.

In each deletion, you are allowed to remove either the first (leftmost) or the last (rightmost) element of the array.

Examples
Example 1:

Input: [3, 2, 5, 1, 4]
Expected Output: 3
Justification: The smallest element is 1 and the largest is 5. Removing 4, 1, and then 5 (or 5, 4, and then 1) in three moves is the most efficient strategy.
