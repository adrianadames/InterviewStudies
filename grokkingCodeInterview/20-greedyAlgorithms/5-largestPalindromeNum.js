Problem Statement
Given a string s containing 0 to 9 digits, create the largest possible palindromic number using the string characters.

A palindromic number reads the same backward as forward.

If it's not possible to form such a number using all digits of the given string, you can skip some of them.

Examples
Input: "323211444"
Expected Output: "432141234"
Justification: This is the largest palindromic number that can be formed from the given digits.
Input: "998877"
Expected Output: "987789"
