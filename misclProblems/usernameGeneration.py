Programming Challenge: Username Generation
❖ You just accepted a position at NYU’s ITS department and your first task is to
write a
program that generates student Net IDs for all incoming freshmen
❖ Net IDs are generated as follows:
❖ The first two characters of a student’s first name
❖ The first two characters of a student’s last name
❖ The last three characters of a student’s N#
❖ Write a program that asks the user for these three pieces of information (first
name,
last name and N#) and generate their Net ID.
❖ Note that if a student’s first name or last name is less than 2 characters then
you
should use the entire first name or last name.
